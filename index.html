      <h4 class="fw-bold">Profiel (About Me)</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        So some specifics of my skill set, and at the bottom a bit about who I am.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>About my environments</strong> – I can work on all operating systems
        (Windows with IIS, Docker, or Apache; Linux with Apache or Docker; Mac OS
        with Apache or Docker). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My Syntax Knowledge</strong> – Laravel, MySQL, CSS, PHP, HTML, 
        JavaScript and jQuery, AWS, GitHub Actions, Flutter & Dart, WordPress, 
        server administration on VPS and shared hosting services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Additional Skills</strong> – 
        AWS hosting and S3 Bucket integration with GitHub Actions automated deployments
        onto AWS VMs, Flutter & Dart development and deployment. Also experience
        with Fastlane for creating Android and iOS app deployments (although I still
        want a bit more time to automate the Fastlane process fully). 
        I have had extensive exposure to Vue.js (though it’s not my strongest framework,
        I can work effectively with it).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>About Me</strong> – I am a highly passionate full stack engineer (websites
        and Flutter apps). I love what I do, and my work speaks for itself. I always 
        aspire to produce quality work, and the more I program the better my work 
        gets. Since the start of my development career I have grown a lot and matured
        as a developer. I’ve worked in small offices and large corporate environments, 
        always staying open to helping others. This collaborative mentality has allowed 
        me to learn from peers and continually improve. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in working as a team because it’s far more productive, and I get to
        learn from other perspectives. I consistently aim to better my skills and love
        to learn from those around me, helping others to the best of my ability.

          <strong>TJIP The Platform Engineer, Netherlands</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Working at Tjip has exceeded my expectations in every way. I’m fortunate to 
          be under outstanding leadership, with a manager who truly sets the standard.
          The team I’m part of is composed of incredibly talented developers. Though 
          my time here has just begun, I can already see a future where I aim to advance 
          and grow alongside this team. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The role aligns with my passion for development. I’m empowered to make 
          decisions based on the skills I was hired for, and I feel my input is genuinely 
          valued. This environment makes my work truly fulfilling, and I look forward 
          to each day, knowing I’m tackling meaningful challenges and making a real 
          impact.

        <p><strong>CoverWeb.online, Johannesburg</strong></p>
        <p>
          Contracting for DigiData was a tough challenge in coming to terms with their
          infrastructure, but overall it was a good experience. I contracted for 2 months, 
          then handed over and supported the transition to a new developer. I oversaw 
          the migration of their flutter app system from their old developer and performed 
          a system analysis for them, plus deployments.

        <p><strong>CoverWeb.online, South Africa</strong></p>
        <p>
          Overhauled a 19-year-old legacy system for Qinisa, plagued by performance
          issues. Integrated three separate systems into one, greatly improving screen 
          load times and establishing robust development pipelines across multiple 
          environments. Championed best practices like documentation and training, 
          often facing client resistance. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately delivered major technical and cost optimizations despite communication
          challenges and sole-developer constraints. This experience underlined the
          importance of communication, documentation, and stakeholder engagement.
