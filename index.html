        <p>
          So some specifics of my skill set. And at the bottom a bit about who I am ;) -- 
          About my environments -- I can work on all operating systems. And dev on them 
          efficiently. - Windows with IIS or Docker or Apache - Linux with Apache or Docker 
          - Mac OS with Apache or Docker
        </p>
        <p>
          -- My Syntax Knowledge. -- Laravel, MySQL, CSS, PHP, HTML, Javascript and 
          Jquery, AWS, Github Actions, Flutter & Dart, WordPress, Server administration on 
          VPS and Shared hosting services.
        </p>
        <p>
          -- About some of my skills -- AWS hosting and S3 Bucket integration with Github 
          Actions automated deployment onto AWS VM's and also Flutter and Dart 
          development and Deployment (F & D is for APP Development) Fastlane (F & D 
          Tool for deployment) exposure for creating deployments for IOS and Android. (I 
          do need a bit more time to automate the fastlane process for apps. But I do have 
          enough experience to likely get there within an additional 3 to 4 weeks of focused 
          work.) Vue JS (Vue is not my strongest but I have extensive exposure wirth the 
          framework)
        </p>
        <p>
          -- About Me -- I am a highly passionate full stack engineer (Websites and Flutter

          gets.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's been a long road for me, but since the beginning of my development career I 
          have certainly grown a lot and matured as an individual and programmer. I have 
          worked in small offices and I have worked in a massive corporate offices and I 
          have always kept myself open to helping others as much as I can and through this 
          mentality I have been able to learn from my peers and better myself as a 
          professional developer.

        <p>
          I consistently aim to better my skills and love to learn from those around me and 
          love helping others to the best of my ability. I believe in working as a team 
          because it's far more productive and I get to learn from other peoples points of 
          view.

          CoverWeb.online, Johannesburg<br><br>
          Contracting for DigiData was a tough challenge coming to terms with their 
          infrastructure but overall a good experience working with them. I contracted for 2 
          months and then did a handover and offered some support transitioning their 
          system over to a new Developer. I essentially over saw the transition of their 
          system for their app from their old developer to their new developer and did a 
          system analysis for them for their flutter app and also did some dployments for 
          them.

          <span class="job-title">Consultant Contract - Full Stack Developer - Laravel (LAMP Stack)</span><br>
          jun 2023 - mrt 2024<br>
          CoverWeb.online, City of Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa<br><br>
          Overview: Engaged in a challenging contract with Qinisa, tasked with overhauling 
          a legacy system plagued by performance issues, resulting from 19 years of 
          compounded development and an outdated database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contributions and Achievements:<br>
          - Integrated three separate systems into a cohesive unit over 10 months,<br>
            enhancing efficiency.<br>
          - Dramatically improved screen load times by rearchitecting the system.<br>
          - Established robust development pipelines across three environments 
            (Development, Pre-Production, Production) and streamlined server and domain 
            costs.<br>
          - Advocated for best practices including documentation, weekly training, and 
            feature tracking, despite client resistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Challenges: Faced significant obstacles due to sole developer status, 
          communication issues, and the client's reluctance towards adopting new 
          processes. The contract was marked by a lack of support for development 
          tracking, documentation, and system training, culminating in a challenging 
          conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conclusion: Despite the difficulties, maintained a professional approach, 
          contributing significantly to Qinisa's operational capabilities through technical 
          improvements and cost optimizations. The experience underscored the 
          importance of communication, documentation, and stakeholder engagement in 
          technical projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflection: This contract highlighted my commitment to excellence and efficiency 
          in the face of adversity, enhancing my technical and managerial skills.

          demonstrate my ability to lead and execute web development projects effectively.

          <span class="job-title">Consultant Contract - WordPress Developer nov 2022 - apr 2023</span><br>
          CoverWeb.online<br><br>
          Overview: My contract role at ALT Agency primarily involved working on standard 
          WordPress projects. The environment was fast-paced, and my responsibilities 
          extended beyond development to include staff training and project management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contributions and Achievements:<br>
          - Training and Guidance: Conducted training sessions for staff, enhancing their 
            skills and understanding of WordPress.<br>
          - Project Scoping: Actively involved in advising on and writing project scopes, 
            ensuring clarity and direction for each project.<br>
          - Process Improvement: Implemented significant changes to the development 
            tools and processes, resulting in an accelerated end-to-end development cycle 
            and improved efficiency.<br>
          - Innovation: Introduced new tools for design and deployment, modernizing the 
            agency's approach to WordPress projects and increasing productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Challenges: During my tenure, I noticed a prioritization of quantity over quality, 
          with a focus on revenue rather than client satisfaction. This approach often led to 
          compromised project outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conclusion: Despite the challenges, my experience at ALT Agency allowed me to 
          contribute positively by streamlining processes, enhancing team skills, and 
          introducing innovative tools. My efforts aimed to uplift the quality of work and client 
          service, addressing the core issues I identified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflection: This role highlighted the importance of balancing efficiency with 
          quality and customer care in the fast-paced environment of web development. 
          My contributions demonstrate my commitment to improving project outcomes 
          and client satisfaction.
