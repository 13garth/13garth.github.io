        <h3>Profiel</h3>
        <p>
          Below is an overview of my core skill set, followed by insights into who I am as a professional.
        </p>
        <h5>About my environments</h5>
        <p>
          I am adept at developing on all major operating systems, ensuring smooth and efficient workflows across platforms such as Windows (IIS, Docker, Apache), Linux (Apache, Docker), and macOS (Apache, Docker).
        </p>
        <h5>My Syntax Knowledge</h5>
        <p>
          My expertise spans Laravel, MySQL, CSS, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, AWS, GitHub Actions, Flutter &amp; Dart, WordPress, and server administration on both VPS and shared hosting environments.
        </p>
        <h5>About some of my skills</h5>
        <p>
          I have extensive experience with AWS hosting and S3 bucket integration, leveraging GitHub Actions for automated deployment to AWS VMs. I also specialize in Flutter and Dart development, including the use of Fastlane for iOS and Android app deployments. My exposure to Vue.js, although not my primary framework, has been substantial. While I continue to refine my expertise in automating Fastlane deployments, I possess the foundational knowledge to deliver high-quality applications and solutions.
        </p>
        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>
          I am a dedicated full stack engineer (specializing in both web and Flutter app development) who is genuinely passionate about my craft. My goal is to consistently produce exceptional work, and I believe my code and output speak for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of my career, I have grown from entry-level beginnings into a mature and confident programmer, gaining invaluable experience in both small and large corporate settings. By proactively offering assistance to colleagues and staying open to feedback, I’ve continuously sharpened my skills and expanded my professional horizons.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ambition is to keep evolving as a developer while actively supporting those around me. Teamwork, in my view, fosters creativity, productivity, and a broader exchange of perspectives—elements I consider essential for high-impact software development.
